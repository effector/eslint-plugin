# Enforces naming convention for Effector-effects (`effector/enforce-effect-naming-convention`)

Enforcing naming conventions helps keep the codebase consistent, and reduces overhead when thinking about how to name a variable with effect. Your effect should be distingueshed by a suffix `Fx`. For example, `fetchUserInfoFx` is a effect, `fetchUserInfo` is not.
